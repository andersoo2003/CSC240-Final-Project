          What is Brachytherapy?
        </h2>
        <p >
          Brachytherapy is a form of internal radiation that is used to treat a wide variety of cancers. The procedure involves placing a series of radioactive “seeds” close to the intended target (like a cancerous <button class = "highlight">tumor</button>). Brachytherapy is a popular form of cancer treatment due to its ability to bypass <button class = "highlight">superficial tissue</button>, unlike radiation therapy (another common cancer treatment).
